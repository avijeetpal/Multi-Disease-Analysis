# 🩺 Multi-Disease Analysis (2015–2024)

## 📘 Overview
This project analyzes **disease trends** across different age groups, genders, years, and regions to identify which populations are most affected by major diseases such as **Cancer**, **Asthma**, and **Heart Problems**.  
The goal is to uncover **health insights** and visualize patterns using **Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- 🔹 Identify which age group (young, middle-aged, senior citizens) has the highest number of disease cases.  
- 🔹 Compare male vs female disease percentage distribution.  
- 🔹 Find the year with the highest recorded disease cases.  
- 🔹 Detect which region has the most reported cases.  
- 🔹 Highlight which disease type (Cancer, Asthma, Heart Problem) dominates each year.

## 🧮 Steps Performed

### 1️⃣ Data Collection
- Collected disease-based data from multiple **Kaggle datasets**.  
- Merged all datasets into a **single CSV file**.

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Removed **duplicates** and **missing values**.  
- Standardized column names and formats.  
- Handled **null entries** and inconsistent data types.

### 3️⃣ Data Transformation
- Grouped data by **age**, **gender**, **disease**, and **region**.  
- Added new columns for classification (e.g., `Age Group → Young, Middle, Senior`).  
- Converted **categorical data** for analysis.

### 4️⃣ Data Analysis
- Used **statistical and aggregation techniques** to calculate:  
  - Total cases per year  
  - Gender-wise percentage distribution  
  - Region-wise and disease-wise counts

### 5️⃣ Data Visualization
- Plotted insights using **Matplotlib**:  
  - 📊 **Histogram**: Yearly disease trends  
  - 📈 **Bar Chart**: Gender and region comparison  
  - 🥧 **Pie Chart**: Disease category distribution  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- 🧓 **Senior citizens** have the highest number of disease cases.  
- ⚖️ Male and female case percentages are approximately **51%** and **49%** respectively.  
- 📅 The year **2016** recorded the highest number of cases.  
- 🌍 The **Australia region** shows the most reported cases.  
- 🎗️ **Cancer** had the highest number of recorded cases overall.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- 🐍 **Python** — Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- 💻 **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code**  
- 📊 **Power BI** (for dashboard visualization)

---

## 🧾 Conclusion
The analysis reveals **critical health trends** across years and demographics.  
Visual insights help understand which populations require more **healthcare attention** and **preventive strategies**.
